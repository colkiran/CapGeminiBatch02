Bitwise Operators
-----------------
5 | 3 

0101		= 0 +  1 * 2 ** 2 + 0 + 1 * 2 ** 0
		= 0 + 4 + 0 + 1
		= 5

0011		


0101
0011

0111		=7

0101
0011
----
0001		= 1

xor
---
0  0 = 0
1  0 = 1
0  1 = 1
1  1 = 0

0110   = 4 + 2

left shift operator

5 << 1              	

0101

1010 = 8 + 2 = 10

1000 << 1

10000 = 16

10100 = 20

0101 >> 1  0010 =

Control Structures and Loops
-----------------------------
control structures 
------------------
1. if condition
2. select case (not supported)

input(prompt user with text)

x = input("enter a number")



Loops
-----
1. for loop
2. while loop

for loop
--------
for loop is same as foreach loop 

foreach loop will depend on a collection

for loop also depends on a collection that is generated by range function


While Loops
-----------

print function
--------------
print(data, sep=, end="\n")

Loops
-----
1. continue
2. break
3. else

solve the problems immediately
------------------------------
1. print the pattern 

1 2 3 4 5
 1 2 3 4
  1 2 3
   1 2
    1
   2 1
  3 2 1
 4 3 2 1
5 4 3 2 1

2. Generate prime numbers between 150 and 50 and also print the count of it

Strings
-------
SRTINGS ARE IMMUTABLE

stings can be enclosed either in " " or ' '

strings are stored like lists or arrays

we can extract every character of the string by their indexes

indexing starts from zero
